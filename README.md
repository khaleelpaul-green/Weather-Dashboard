Description:
The concept being focused on in this assignment was server-side APIs, and the task was to create a weather dashboard made from scratch that needed to host various features 
(outlined in README located in Assets/project-outline), such as allowing users to input a city into search bar and recieve the current weather in addition to 
the five day forecast for that given city. In order to accomplish this I need to access a server to gather the necessary weather data and my approach was to make two calls to 
the OpenWeather APIs (https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api), the first call was to acquire the longitude and latitude values for the entered city, that were then 
inputt into the url of the second API call that would then produce all of the weather data needed to display for the user.

Bugs/Missing Features:
There are a couple bugs, such as the search history updates being delayed by a second press of the search button.
